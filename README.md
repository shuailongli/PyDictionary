# PyDictionary
This program is running in the command line framework. Basic functions include text speaking, word lookup, English-to-Chinese translation, Youtube audio play and download. In addition, users can add and save new words, sentences and listening materials to the notebook.

<h2>Demos</h2>
<h3>Word Lookup and English-to Chinese Translation</h3>

These two functions are initiated with the command `translate`, followed by the word to look up or the English sentence to translate. If the target content contains only one single word, `translate` will return the word definitions from [Google Dictionary-Chinese](https://gdictchinese.freecollocation.com), otherwise,  a Chinese translation from [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) will be returned.

**Example**

```
PyDict> translate eminent

1. of people人famous and respected, especially in a particular profession（尤指在某专业中）卓越的，著名的，显赫的
   -an eminent architect著名的建筑师

2. of good qualities良好品质unusual; excellent非凡的；杰出的
   -a man of eminent good sense极其明智的人
```


```
PyDict> translate The abilities of modern neural networks are the result of the interactions of thousands of neurons (sometimes tens of thousands or more!).

现代神经网络的能力是成千上万个神经元（有时成千上万个或更多！）相互作用的结果。
```

<h3>Text Speaking</h3>

Started with command `speak` and followed by the text to speak. This command will play the audio of the English text.

**Syntax**
```
PyDict> speak any_text
```

<h3>Save to Notebook</h3>
PyDictionary provides the basic setups to help study English vocabularies, sentences and listening materials by saving them to notebook. Three setups are implemented in three modes:

<ul>
<li><h4>vocabulary</h4>

Enter the vocabulary mode
 ```
PyDict> vocabulary
 ```
 Add a word to notebook
 ```
 PyDict> add
word: apple
meaning: a round fruit with shiny red or green skin and firm white flesh
example: an apple pie
---Added word: 
   * apple
   * a round fruit with shiny red or green skin and firm white flesh
   * an apple pie
```
After executing `add` in the first line, a block to store a word in the notebook is created. A word block contains three entries: word, meaning and example. While the word entry is required to save a word block to notebook, the other two are optional.

List all saved word blocks
```
---------------------
PyDict> all

   * apple
   * a round fruit with shiny red or green skin and firm white flesh
   * an apple pie
   * 0
---------------------
```
The integer in the fourth entry records the number of times the word has been studied. If `all` is followed by a string, the list will restrict to words initiated by that string.

Users can also listen to the saved words by executing
```
PyDict> play apple
```

Remove a word from notebook
```
PyDict> remove apple
Are you sure to remove: 
   * apple
   * a round fruit with shiny red or green skin and firm white flesh
   * an apple pie
   * 0
(y/n): y
apple removed from notebook
```

<li><h4>sentence</h4>

Enter sentence mode
```
PyDict> sentence
```

This mode works similarly to the vocabulary mode: use the `add` command to add a sentence to the notebook, `all` to display, `play` to speak and `remove` to remove the sentence.

<li><h4>listening</h4>

Enter sentence mode
```
PyDict> listening
```
Users can extract and download audios from interesting Youtube videos in this mode. 

Add an audio to notebook through the Youtube link
```
PyDict> add 
Youtube link: https://youtu.be/yIZ95TBD85c
name: US Surpasses 19 Million COVID-19 Cases Amid Fears Of Holiday Surge

```
The first entry in the audio block displays the Youtube video ID. Note that all audios in the notebook are referred through their Youtube ID. Again, users use the command `all` to list, `play` to play and `remove` to remove the audios.
</ul>
